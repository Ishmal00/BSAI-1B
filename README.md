# Data Visualization Project 🎨📊

## Project Description  
This project focuses on visualizing and analyzing data from an **online foods dataset**, which contains demographic, geographic, and user feedback details. The dataset includes 388 entries with information about individuals' occupations, incomes, family sizes, and their feedback on online food services.

## Dataset Information  
The dataset contains the following columns:  
1. **Age**: Age of the individual.  
2. **Gender**: Gender (Male/Female).  
3. **Marital Status**: Single or Married.  
4. **Occupation**: Occupation type (e.g., Student, Employee).  
5. **Monthly Income**: Income category.  
6. **Educational Qualifications**: Education level (Graduate/Post Graduate).  
7. **Family Size**: Number of members in the family.  
8. **Latitude/Longitude**: Geographic location.  
9. **Pin Code**: Postal code of the area.  
10. **Output**: Outcome (e.g., Yes/No).  
11. **Feedback**: Feedback category (Positive/Negative).  

## Key Steps in the Project  
1. **Data Load 🔄**  
   - Import and load the dataset into a Jupyter Notebook using Python's pandas library.  
2. **Data Cleaning 🧹**  
   - Handle missing values and irrelevant data (if any).  
3. **Data Preprocessing 🛠️**  
   - Convert categorical columns to numerical (if needed) and normalize data.  
4. **Data Augmentation 🌱**  
   - Add new features to the dataset to enhance analysis.  
5. **Data Save 💾**  
   - Save the cleaned and processed dataset for future use.  

## Visualizations  
1. **Bar Chart**: To visualize category distributions (e.g., Gender or Occupation).  
2. **Line Chart**: To show trends (e.g., feedback trends over age).  
3. **Pie Chart**: To display proportions (e.g., feedback percentages).  
4. **Heatmap**: To analyze correlations between numerical columns (e.g., Age and Family Size).  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python**: Programming language for data analysis and visualization.  
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for code and analysis.
